                <p>Nobody Owens, known to his friends as Bod, is a perfectly normal boy. Well, he would be perfectly normal if he didn't live in a graveyard,
                    being raised and educated by ghosts, with a solitary guardian who belongs to neither the world of the living nor the world of the dead.
                    There are dangers and adventures for Bod in the graveyard: the strange and terrible menace of the Sleer;
                    a gravestone entrance to a desert that leads to the city of ghouls; friendship with a witch, and so much more.
                    But it is in the land of the living that real danger lurks, for it is there that the man Jack lives and he has already killed Bod's family.
                    A deliciously dark masterwork by bestselling author Neil Gaiman, with illustrations by award-winning Dave McKean.</p>

                <p>Begin your journey into Middle-earth.
                    The inspiration for the upcoming original series on Prime Video, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.
                    The Two Towers is the second part of J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic adventure The Lord of the Rings.
                    One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
                    Frodo and his Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom.
                    They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in a battle in the Mines of Moria. And Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape,
                    the rest of the company was attacked by Orcs. Now they continue the journey alone down the great River Anduin—alone,
                    that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go.</p>

                <p>Ember St. George is a dragon. At least she was before her adoptive father—a powerful but accident-prone Magician—turned her into a human girl to save her life.
                    Unfortunately, Ember’s growing tendency to burst into flames at certain temperatures—not to mention her invisible wings—is making it too dangerous for her to stay in London.
                    The solution: ship Ember off to her aunt’s research station in frigid Antarctica.
                    Though eccentric Aunt Myra takes getting used to, Ember quickly feels at home in a land of ice storms,
                    mischievous penguins, and twenty-four-hour nights. She even finds herself making friends with a girl genius called Nisha and a mysterious orphan named Moss.
                    Then she discovers that Antarctica is home to the Winterglass Hunt,
                    a yearly tradition in which rare ice dragons are hunted for their jeweled scales. Furious, Ember decides to join the hunt to sabotage it from the inside.
                    But being an undercover dragon isn’t easy—especially among dragon hunters.
                    Can a twelve-year-old fire dragon survive the dangers that come her way in the Antarctic wilderness and protect the ice dragons from extinction?</p>

                <p>Emma Woodhouse is one of Austen's most captivating and vivid characters.
                    Beautiful, spoilt, vain and irrepressibly witty,
                    Emma organizes the lives of the inhabitants of her sleepy little village and plays matchmaker with devastating effect.</p>
